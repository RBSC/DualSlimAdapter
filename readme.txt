About
-----

This is the adapter board to connect two slim floppy drives to a single 34-pin FDD interface cable. There could be also a combination
of a slim floppy drive, for example MPF820 and a slim Gotek drive, for example SFRM72-DU26. Now you don't need to have 2 drive bays
in your MSX computer - you can have 2 drives in a single bay!

The 3D printed parts to join 2 slim drives into one solution, suitable for a single drive bay can be found here:

See the pictures in the Pics folder on how to assemble and install the DualSlim setup in MSX2 computer that has a single floppy drive
bay. Note the picture for the AX-350 MSX2 fix - you will need to solder one wire for the DualSlim setup in this computer.
